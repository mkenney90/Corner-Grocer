# Corner-Grocer
CS-210 Project 3


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project had clear requirements:

"The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers."

The solution was building a terminal application that presented the user with easy menu items to choose from in order to access the information they needed.
    
    What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did a great job following "separation of concerns" protocol and ensuring every function only handled one action. This is crucial for readable and scalable code.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could probably use more efficient loops. Being that I was on a time constraint and had limited resources (including unreliable internet access), I'm not overly concerned about it.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

C++ is a challenge just to compile properly on a Windows machine. Even with the most up-to-date version of Visual Studio, I ran into nothing but issues trying to get the code to build and execute. I would honestly probably never use C++ (at least on Windows) again if given the choice (most of my work is done in Python or Java). That being said, pointers get confusing at times but Visual Studio (when it actually works) does a good job keep them organized for you.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The ability to link two different programming languages together can be invaluable depending on the scope of the project. As a software developer, the code bases I work on often mix two or more languages together on the same project, and being able to switch between writing any of them at any given time takes practice and effort to perfect, but makes you a much more effective programmer.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Clear commenting and documentation are my go-to methods for making my code maintainable and easier to understand. Further, using clear and concise variable and method names goes a long way when it comes to readability, and I've never regretted sacrificing an imperceptible amount of performance for code that can be understood more easily.
